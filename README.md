# Sourcerer MCP ðŸ§™

An MCP server that helps AI agents work with large codebases efficiently without burning through costly tokens.
Instead of reading entire files or using fragile find-and-replace operations that force agents to retry and burn tokens,
Sourcerer provides stable addressing that lets agents work with specific code chunks directly.
